# Higgs Bundles Twisted by a Vector Bundle

This is the text of a Master Thesis of the Master of Advanced Mathematics at Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

A Higgs bundle over a compact Riemann surface X is a pair (E,f), where E is a holomorphic vector bundle E over X 
and f is an endomorphism twisted by the canonical bundle K. These objects were introduced by
Nigel Hitchin more than 30 years ago. The moduli space M(n,d) of stable Higgs bundles of fixed rank n and degree d 
has a very rich geometric structure, in particular it is an algebraically integrable system. Evaluating f in a base of
invariant polynomials by GL(n,C) in the space of complex nxn matrices one gets the Hitchin map, whose 
generic fibre is the Jacobian of the *spectral curve* that lives within the total space of K.

In this dissertation we explore a generalization of the theory of Higgs bundles over compact
Riemann surfaces, in which the canonical line bundle is replaced by a vector bundle of arbitrary
rank. This kind of situation appears naturally in the study of supersymmetric gauge theories.
From the mathematical point of view, we study several topics: analogous of Hitchin’s equations,
stability, Hitchin–Kobayashi correspondence and a generalization of the spectral curve.
